            <h2>Navigational Map Reading Competencies</h2>

            <p>
                With the help of OriGami, we take a closer look at  <b>measuring</b> and <b>training</b> navigational map reading competencies
                with primary and lower secondary school children. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have developed a  <b> test instrument</b> with which we can determine
                what kind of skills children have orienting and navigating with a map. We implemented the test 
                for two selected locations and successfully evaluated it in a study. The children that participated in our study  
                had the task of using OriGami to solve map reading tasks in a park environment. In doing so, they had to orient  
                themselves with spatial information such as the arrangement of paths, benches, trash cans and trees, which were displayed on the map. <br>
                Our test is designed to be transferable to other locations. Those interested can download our Reproducible Paper 
                and implement the test for the location of their choice. 
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                We have also developed the test for virtual space to make it usable regardless of location. 
                The results of the associated study are currently being evaluated by out team. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In the next step, we would like to use OriGami to develop  <b>learning modules</b> that
                can be used to train children in their map-based orientation. 
                For this purpose, we have equipped OriGami with a variety of map features 
                to help children learn suitable strategies.

            <h2>Collaborative learning</h2>

            <p>
                We are currently developing OriGami into a multi-user learning app. 
                Our goal is to encourage children in their collaborative learning strategies and to explore children's map-based collaboration strategies.  
                More information about the multi-user functionality will follow here soon.
