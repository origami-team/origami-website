                <h2>Liability for contents</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general 
                    legislation pursuant to § 7 section 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG,
                    however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information 
                    or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.</p>
                <p>Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected. However,
                    liability in this regard is only possible from the point of time at which a concrete infringement of the law 
                    becomes known. If we become aware of such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.</p>

                <h2>Liability for links</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore,
                    we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is 
                    always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations
                    at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control 
                    of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become
                    aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.</p>
