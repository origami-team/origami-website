                <p>
                    To play GeoGami you need a GPS-enabled smartphone or tablet  
                    with internet access and a built-in compass. The highest accuracy is achieved  
                    with a device that has a SIM card. 
                    The Android version is only available as an APK file and not yet in the 
                    Store. The browser version is suitable for creating the games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another technology that GeoGami can use to determine location are   
                    Bluetooth beacons. The small transmitters are placed in the area 
                    and allow an even more precise locating than GPS. We are currently
                    working on the implementation of the beacons!
